This repository is for the projects I've done on the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

The program prepares me for a career as a Data Analyst / Analytics professional by helping me learn:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Wrangling
- Data Cleaning
- Practical Statistics (i.e. applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
- SQL for Data Analysis
- Data Visualization to draw meaningful conclusions

## Technical Skills utilized
* Python
* Data Analysis/Wrangling libraries (Numpy, Pandas)
* Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebooks
* SQL
